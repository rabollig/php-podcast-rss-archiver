This is a little script to download podcasts and archive them to S3.

Sometimes podcasts go away completely.  Sometimes podcasts remove old episodes (apparently some feed readers
cannot handle a huge number of episodes).  Occasionally, episodes go behind a paywall.

Since storage is pretty cheap these days, I wanted to start saving podcasts I enjoy and want to refer back to
from time to time.

This is a really simple script written on a rainy afternoon, but it may be useful to others as a working example
of getting RSS feeds.  There are many features that are lacking.

Pull requests welcome.
